## v0.1.11 (3 Apr 2019)

This release is mostly adding support for additional launchpad devices. However, while testing I unfortunately found that the hardware might have an issue on the USB power supply (in fact there is quite some ripple on the internal 5V power rail) leading to spurious resets of the launchpad. Connecting the launchpad through an externally powered USB hub seems to fix the issue. Therefore it is beneficial to run the launchpad with dimmed leds (default). For now, the brightness can be adjusted by pressing `8` + `6` on the launchpad. I will investigate the hardware issue as soon as possible.

#### Improvements

- Added preliminary support for Launchpad S and Launchpad Mk2

#### Fixes

- Fixed launchpad display regression (some sequence data was displayed in wrong colors)
